the challenge here is to take an existing repo that's only a year old and bringing it to the current standard of React features, idioms and appropriate style.

part of this is getting it up to speed with modern build tools.  2015 brought a feast of JavaScript build tools with popular community preferences seeming to change every few months.  note that the repo included here is a year old and is not using npm and Webpack the way we did in the rest of this workshop.  

> hint: try reusing `package.json` and `webpack.config.js`

also note that most of the code here is much harder to read than the previous version of this demo that you saw in "component kata" earlier.  that one was rewritten to make things a little cleaner for you.  try to do the same now with this code.
