starter kits are a great way to save time on getting setup on a new project.  they're also a bit of a nightmare to work with if you haven't spent enough time digging through them to build up an intuitive sense of what's missing in terms of package versioning, configuration settings and variations on those settings, complementary tools, configuration gotchas, etc.

the hardest part is that as developers we don't spend much of our time doing this to begin with -- it's usually an investment we make at the beginning of a project or if something isn't working for us during our dev cycle.

with that, have a look through at least 5 of these starter kits collected by Andrew Farmer here: http://andrewhfarmer.com/starter-project

you can filter them number of stars, number of dependencies and recent activity.  

I recommend you filter them by "least dependencies" first and avoid digging into any starter kits that claim to get you up and running with 12 different technologies at the outset.  in other words, it helps to learn to walk before we run.

if you find a good starter kit, ie. one that seems understandable, behaves in a predictable way and actually gets some useful work done, then fork it.  it's always a net positive: reducing the time from "wanting to code" to "actually coding" once the mood strikes.
